# AgentSDK Active Context

## Current Focus: Project Bootstrap & Foundation

### Immediate Objectives

1. **Establish Core Architecture**: Create the complete project scaffold with all packages and initial structure
2. **Implement Specification**: Build the AgentSDK JSON Schema v0.1 as the foundation
3. **Create Demo Example**: Implement the CatFacts AgentSDK to validate the specification
4. **Build Core Runtime**: Develop the essential runner and export modules

### Active Work Session

- **Status**: Fresh project initialization
- **Priority**: Foundation-first approach - establish solid base before advanced features
- **Approach**: Follow the technical summary's build order exactly

### Current Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Foundation (In Progress)

1. ‚úÖ Memory bank structure established
2. üîÑ Project scaffold creation
3. ‚è≥ AgentSDK JSON Schema v0.1
4. ‚è≥ CatFacts demo AgentSDK
5. ‚è≥ OpenAI tools exporter
6. ‚è≥ Basic runner implementation

#### Phase 2: Validation (Next)

1. Evaluation harness setup
2. Baseline vs AgentSDK comparison
3. Metrics collection and reporting

#### Phase 3: Enhancement (Future)

1. OpenAPI converter implementation
2. LLM-powered enricher
3. Additional API examples (Slack/GitHub)

### Key Decisions Made

- **TypeScript/Node.js**: Primary technology stack for JSON/schema ecosystem
- **JSON Schema 2020-12**: Specification format for validation and tooling
- **AJV**: Validation library for runtime schema enforcement
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized packages for modularity and reusability

### Current Challenges

- **Schema Design**: Balancing simplicity vs completeness in v0.1 spec
- **Tool Integration**: Ensuring seamless export to OpenAI function calling format
- **Metrics Collection**: Defining meaningful performance indicators

### Next Steps

1. Complete project scaffold with all required directories
2. Implement and validate AgentSDK JSON Schema
3. Create working CatFacts example to prove the concept
4. Build functional OpenAI tools exporter
5. Develop basic runner with HTTP execution and validation

### Dependencies & Blockers

- None currently identified
- All required information provided in technical summary
- Clear path forward established

### Success Criteria for Current Phase

- [ ] Complete project structure matches technical summary
- [ ] AgentSDK schema validates correctly
- [ ] CatFacts example loads and exports to OpenAI tools
- [ ] Basic runner can execute tool calls with validation
- [ ] Foundation ready for evaluation harness implementation

### Notes

- Following exact build order from technical summary: spec ‚Üí demo ‚Üí export ‚Üí runner ‚Üí eval
- Prioritizing working proof-of-concept over feature completeness
- Maintaining focus on core objective: proving AgentSDK superiority over baseline approaches
