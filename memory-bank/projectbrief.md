# AgentSDK Project Brief

## Core Objective

Create a new type of SDK architecture specifically designed for AI coding agents, establishing the gold standard for converting Human Readable SDKs into Machine Readable SDKs optimized for AI agent consumption.

## Primary Goals

1. **Prove Efficiency**: Demonstrate that structured AgentSDK (JSON + semantics) yields:
   - Fewer invalid tool calls
   - Lower token usage / latency
   - Equal or higher task success rates
   - vs. baseline where models read human docs (RAG) or minimal tool manifests

2. **Establish Standard**: Create the definitive architecture and conversion methodology for agent-first SDK design

3. **Enable Ecosystem**: Build tooling that allows easy conversion and adoption of existing APIs into agent-optimized formats

## Success Criteria

- AgentSDK shows measurable improvements in agent performance metrics
- Complete toolchain for OpenAPI â†’ AgentSDK conversion
- Evaluation harness proving superiority over traditional approaches
- Working examples with real APIs (CatFacts, Slack/GitHub)

## Key Innovation

Moving from human-readable documentation to machine-optimized structured representations that include:

- Semantic annotations for agent behavior
- Guardrails and error handling patterns
- Usage patterns and anti-patterns
- Structured validation and execution runtime

## Target Users

- AI agent developers
- API providers wanting agent-friendly interfaces
- Tool calling systems and frameworks
- LLM application builders

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Core architecture + CatFacts demo + evaluation
- **Phase 2**: Real API integration (Slack/GitHub) + converter tools
- **Phase 3**: LLM-powered enrichment + ecosystem tools
