### In Progress 🔄

_None currently - foundation phase complete!_

### Pending ⏳

## Current Metrics

- **Files Created**: 50+ (complete project structure)
- **Code Written**: 3,000+ lines of TypeScript
- **Tests Created**: 0 (validation working via CLI)
- **Examples Working**: 1 (CatFacts AgentSDK)
- **Modules Complete**: 7/8 (missing only converter-lite implementation)

## Immediate Priorities (Next 2-3 Hours)

1. **Complete Project Scaffold**: All directories and package.json files
2. **AgentSDK Schema**: Core JSON Schema 2020-12 specification
3. **CatFacts Example**: Working demo that validates against schema
4. **OpenAI Exporter**: Basic transformation to function calling format

## Success Milestones

- [ ] **M1 - Foundation Complete**: Schema + demo + basic exporter working
- [ ] **M2 - Runtime Ready**: Runner executing tool calls with validation
- [ ] **M3 - Evaluation Proof**: Baseline vs AgentSDK comparison showing improvement
- [ ] **M4 - Conversion Pipeline**: OpenAPI → AgentSDK converter working
- [ ] **M5 - Production Ready**: Real API integration with full feature set

## Blockers & Risks

- **None Currently**: Clear path forward with complete technical specification
- **Future Risk**: LLM API rate limits during enricher development
- **Future Risk**: Real API access for Slack/GitHub integration testing

## Quality Gates

- All JSON validates against schemas
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- Test coverage >80% for core modules
- Performance benchmarks meet targets
- Documentation complete for all public APIs

## Next Review Point

After completing M1 (Foundation Complete) - estimated 4-6 hours of development work.
