# AgentSDK Product Context

## Problem Statement

Current AI agents struggle with API consumption due to:

- **High Token Usage**: Verbose human documentation consumes excessive context
- **Invalid Tool Calls**: Lack of structured validation leads to frequent errors
- **Poor Error Handling**: No standardized retry/recovery patterns
- **Missing Semantics**: Human docs don't capture agent-relevant behavior patterns

## Solution Vision

AgentSDK transforms APIs into agent-optimized formats by providing:

### Structured Representation

- JSON Schema-based operation definitions
- Precise input/output validation
- Semantic annotations (x-\* extensions)

### Agent-Specific Features

- **Guardrails**: Rate limiting, preconditions, retry policies
- **Error Patterns**: Structured error codes with recovery hints
- **Usage Patterns**: Multi-step workflows and best practices
- **Anti-Patterns**: Common mistakes to avoid

### Conversion Pipeline

1. **Converter**: Deterministic OpenAPI â†’ AgentSDK transformation
2. **Enricher**: LLM-powered semantic enhancement
3. **Exporters**: Generate tool schemas for different platforms (OpenAI, MCP)
4. **Runtime**: Validation, execution, and metrics collection

## User Experience

### For Agent Developers

- Import AgentSDK JSON
- Get validated tool schemas automatically
- Benefit from built-in error handling and retries
- Access usage patterns for complex workflows

### For API Providers

- Convert existing OpenAPI specs
- Enrich with agent-specific semantics
- Publish agent-optimized versions
- Track agent usage patterns

## Value Proposition

- **Efficiency**: Reduced tokens and latency
- **Reliability**: Fewer invalid calls and better error handling
- **Productivity**: Faster agent development with proven patterns
- **Standards**: Consistent approach across different APIs

## Success Metrics

- Token usage reduction: Target 30-50% vs RAG approaches
- Invalid call reduction: Target 80%+ vs unstructured approaches
- Task success rate: Equal or better than human doc approaches
- Developer adoption: Measurable time savings in agent development
